**Horrors [12 PL, 190pts]:** Daemonic Icon, Instrument of Chaos, Smite

**Rules:** *Daemonic Ritual*

**5x Blue Horror**

**Unit:** *Blue Horror*

**20x Pink Horror:** 20x Coruscating flames

**Unit:** *Pink Horror*, **Weapon:** *Coruscating flames*

**Profiles:**

**Daemonic Icon:** Description:If you roll a 1 when taking a Morale test for a unit with any Daemonic Icons, reality blinks and the daemonic horde is bolstered. No models flee and D6 slain Pink Horrors are instead added to the unit.

**Ephemeral Daemons:** Description:Pink Horrors have an invulnerable save of 4+. Blue Horrors have an invulnerable save of 5+. Pairs of Brimstone Horrors have an invulnerable save of 6+.

**Instrument of Chaos:** Description:A unit that includes any Instruments of Chaos adds 1 to their Advance and charge rolls.

**Iridescent Horror:** Description:When you set up this unit for the first time, you may select a single Pink Horror in the unit - that model has an Attacks characteristic of 2, instead of 1.

**Magic Made Manifest:** Description:A unit of Horrors can attempt to manifest one psychic power in each friendly Psychic phase, and attempt to deny one psychic power in each enemy Psychic phase. However, when you do so, only roll a single D6 for the Psychic test or Deny the Witch test, and use the result of the single dice roll to determine the outcome. Note that this means that Horrors can't roll a double 1 or double 6 to suffer Perils of the Warp. In addition, if the unit manifests the Smite power whilst it contains less than 10 Pink Horrors, it only inflicts 1 mortal wound rather than D3.

**Magical Horde:** Description:Change the Type of this unit's coruscating flames to Assault 3 whilst the unit contains 20 or more Pink Horrors.

**Split:** Description:Each time a Pink Horror is slain, you can add up to two Blue Horrors to this unit before you remove the slain model. Each time a Blue Horror is slain, you can add one pair of Brimstone Horrors to this unit before you remove the slain model. The replacement models cannot be placed within 1" of an enemy model. Note that Horrors that flee do not generate any extra models for their unit.  Matched Play: In matched play you must pay reinforcement points for each and every Blue and Brimstone Horror model that you add to a unit of Horrors, but the additional models can take the unit above its starting strength.

**Smite:** Warp Charge:5|Range:18"|Details:Smite has a warp charge value of 5. If manifested, the closest visible enemy unit within 18" of the psyker suffers D3 mortal wounds (pg 181). If the result of the Psychic test was more than 10 the target suffers D6 mortal wounds instead.

**Psyker:** Cast:1|Deny:1|Powers Known:Smite|Other:When manifesting or denying a psychic power, first select a model in the unit - measure range, visibility, etc. from this model. If a Brimstone Horror is selected, it is slain after the psychic power has been used.
