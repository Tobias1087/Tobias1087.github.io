**++ Roster Rules ++**


. **Household Traditions:** If your army is Battle-forged, all units in an IMPERIAL KNIGHTS Super-heavy Detachment (other than FREEBLADE units) must be from the same Household, but they will all gain a Household Tradition (with the exception of FREEBLADE units, detailed opposite).  The Household Tradition gained depends upon the household they are drawn from, as shown on the page opposite.  For example, HOUSE TERRYN units with the Household Traditions ability gain the Gallant Warriors tradition.

If you have chosen a QUESTOR IMPERIALIS household that does not have an associated Household Tradition, you can choose the Questor Imperialis Household Tradition that best describes the character and fighting style of your knightly house.  Similarly, if you have chosen a QUESTOR MECHANICUS household that does not have an associated Household Tradition, you can choose the Questor Mechanicus Household Tradition that best describes the character and fighting style of your knightly house. (Codex: Imperial Knights)

. **Knight Lance:** If your army is Battle-forged, select one model in each IMPERIAL KNIGHTS Super-heavy Detachment in your army.  Each model you selected gains the CHARACTER keyword.  However, the Command Benefit of each Imperial Knights Super-heavy Detachment is changed to 'None' unless it contains any combination of at least three QUESTORIS CLASS and/or DOMINUS CLASS units. (Codex: Imperial Knights)
