**Profiles:**

**Artefact: Lightning Field:** Description:The bearer of the Lightning Field has a 4+ invulnerable save.  In addition, roll a D6 for each enemy unit that is within 1" of the bearer at the start of the Fight phase.  On a 4+ that unit suffers a mortal wound.

**Explodes (Barge):** Description:If this model is reduced to 0 wounds, roll a D6 before removing it from the battlefield.  On a 6 it explodes, and each unit within 3" suffers a mortal wound.

**Hovering (Ark/Barge):** Description:Instead of measuring distances and ranges to and from this model's base, measure to and from this model's hull or base (whichever is closer).

**Quantum Shielding:** Description:Each time this model fails a saving throw, roll a D6.  If the result is less than the damage inflicted by that attack, the damage is ignored (e.g. if this model suffers 4 damage, if you then roll a 3 or less the damage is ignored).  Quantium Shielding cannot prevent damage caused by mortal wounds.

**Warlord Trait (Sautekh): Hyperlogical Strategist:** Description:Once per battle, you can re-roll a single hit roll, wound roll, or damage roll made for your Warlord.

**++ Selection Rules ++**


**Living Metal:** At the beginning of your turn, this unit regains 1 lost wound.

**Reanimation Protocols:** Roll a D6 for each slain model from this unit (unless the whole unit has been completely destroyed) at the beginning of your turn.  Do not roll for models that have fled the unit.  On a 5+, the model's reanimation protocols activate and it is returned to this unit with its full compliment of wounds, otherwise it remains inactive (although you can roll again at the start of each of your subsequent turns). When a modelâ€™s reanimation protocols activate, set it up in unit coherency with any model from this unit that has not returned to the unit as a result of reanimation protocols this turn, and more than 1" from enemy models.  If you cannot do this because there is no room to place the model, do not set it up (you can make Reanimation Protocols rolls for this model again in subsequent turns).

**Their Number is Legion, Their Name is Death:** If your army is Battle-Forged, all Troops units in NECRONS Detachments gain this ability.  Such a unit that is within range of an objective marker (as specified in the mission) controls that objective marker even if there are more enemy models within range of it.  If an enemy unit within range of the same objective marker has a similar ability, then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range of it as normal.
